# Floor Slope Analysis – Revit Add-in

A Revit add-in for analyzing and visualizing floor slopes directly from geometry.  
Designed for BIM workflows where accurate slope detection and quick visual feedback are essential.

---

## 🔍 Overview

**Floor Slope Analysis** allows users to select multiple floor elements and automatically evaluate their slopes based on actual geometric data.  
The add-in works with flat floors, sloped floors, and slab-shaped floors without modifying any geometry.

---

## ✨ Features

- Manual selection of multiple floor elements
- Supports:
  - Flat floors
  - Sloped floors
  - Slab-shaped floors (shape-edited floors)
- Calculates slope percentage from geometry
- Detects top planar faces automatically
- Visual slope feedback using color indicators
- Safe cancel handling during selection
- No permanent model changes

## 🧩 Supported Revit Versions

- Revit 2020  
- Revit 2021  
- Revit 2022  
- Revit 2023  
- Revit 2024

2. The installer automatically places:
   - `.dll`
   - `.addin`
   files into the correct Revit Add-ins folders.
3. Launch Revit.
4. The **Floor Slope Analysis** command will appear in the ribbon.

To uninstall, use Windows **Apps & Features**.

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Open a Revit project.
2. Click **Floor Slope Analysis** from the ribbon.
3. Select one or more floor elements.
4. Slopes are analyzed and visualized directly in the model.
